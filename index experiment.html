    <h2>what is it?</h2>
      <p>Whether it’s called astral projection, out of body experience (OBE), or lucid dreaming, it’s one of those things that you don’t really know if it’s true until you experience it for yourself. You may hear someone claim they had an OBE or read about people having an NDE (near death experience). The stories range from “I suddenly found myself floating above my body in bed” to “I flew through the universe, spoke to God, and got all the answers to life’s biggest questions.”<br><br>
      It’s all about consciousness. Is there one reality that everyone experiences? Or does each person experience their own reality inside their heads? Where do we go when we dream? Why does it feel real until we wake up? What is reality anyway?<br><br>
      Some people are skeptical if OBEs are real or are a just a “trick of the mind.” You can debate about this all day but the point is to try to experience it for yourself and come up with your own answers. Whether it’s “real” or not doesn’t matter. What matters is that you definitely experience something completely extraordinary. It will leave you questioning everything you thought was possible.</p>

    <h2>alarm method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Set your alarm for 4 hours after you go to bed. You’ll be getting up in the middle of the night to do this. The reason for this is to get some REM sleep and dream cycles in. You are more likely to have an OBE or lucid dream after you’ve already been sleeping for a few hours. You will be more relaxed and more “ready” so to speak.
        </li><br>
        <li>Keep yourself occupied for 10-20 minutes. You’re staying awake long enough to not fall immediately back to sleep. It helps if you read or think about OBE a lot during the day. Meditating (or sitting in silence) for 5-10 minutes will help and relax the mind and body and get you in a state of mindfulness. Mindfulness helps you stay aware as you drift off to sleep.
          </li><br>
        <li>Go back to bed, but not in your normal bed. Try the couch or a spare bedroom that you don’t normally sleep in. The slight difference in familiarity will keep your mind more “alert” so you don’t fall asleep as easily. We’re trying to delicately stay aware while our body drifts off to sleep.
          </li><br>
        <li>Lie still for at least 30 minutes. This is important. Try lying on your back in a relaxed position. If you want, listen to a guided meditation or OBE instruction. If successful, as you fall asleep your consciousness will project into that location.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  <div id="rope" div class="item" data-category="rope">
    <h2>rope method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Relax your mind and body. You may choose to meditate or perform a series of very deep breaths. In and out, always very slowly. Make sure you inhale deeply and that your breaths are not shallow.
          </li><br>
        <li>After you feel fully relaxed, you need to enter a hypnotic state where your mind is at the edge of sleep and no further. Now lie down and focus on an object. Stare at it until you can visualize it perfectly even with your eyes closed.
          </li><br>
        <li>Now it’s time to enter a deeper state of relaxation. Your eyes are still closed and you are still visualizing your chosen object. But now you look around you with your eyes closed. Gaze into the darkness.        After a while you may see light patterns dance across your eyes. Just ignore them and they will go away. Once they disappear you’ve entered a deeper state of relaxation.
          </li><br>
        <li>This is the most vital step and it’s when you enter into a state of vibration. This state may take longer if you are new to this. When you do begin to feel the vibrations, your astral body has begun to leave your physical body. Just acknowledge this and feel the vibrations.
        </li><br>
        <li>Focus on the vibrations as they travel throughout your body. Using your willpower, control them with your mind. As you feel them, try to control the frequency of the waves as well as stopping and starting them.
        </li><br>
        <li>Imagining that there is a long rope hanging right above you. Without opening your eyes or moving your physical body, visualize yourself reaching up towards the rope.

        Once you grab a hold of the rope, bring your hand back into your physical body, slow down the vibrations, and end the session.
        </li><br>
        <li>Now that you’ve done a partial separation you’re ready to try the whole body. Repeat the previous 6 steps but this time, don’t stop at just one hand. Imagine your other hand coming out of your physical body and reaching for the rope. Slowly place hand over hand on the rope as if you were pulling yourself up.

        You may feel a little dizzy at this point and the vibrations will buzz at a higher frequency. Often people here feel paralyzed or shrink back into their physical bodies. But concentrate on climbing the rope. Don’t stop until you feel your entire self separating from your body.

      <h2>did it work?</h2>
       Once you get out of body and things seem stable, do something! I typically leave the house through my front door (by habit). I know that I could walk through the walls or even think myself to a new location, but I’m not that advanced yet. While I’m out, I just notice how things look. Often they are slightly different than the “real world” I just came from. Sometimes I talk to people that I see (are they other astral travelers, dream characters, dead people, or what?). I sometimes look at my hands or what I’m wearing. I look in the bathroom mirror for weird results! This is up to you. There’s an infinite amount of things you can do in this state, and once you get here, your only limit is your imagination!
    </div>
    <div id="failure">
      <h2>not working?</h2>
      <p>If nothing happens, just go to sleep. Forget about having an OBE tonight, try again the next night. Loosely pay attention to any hypnogogic imagery (imaginations, visuals, colors, etc). Don’t have any attachment or expectation. You already did your practice, so good work.<br><br>
      You have to put in effort, but you can’t try too hard otherwise you won’t be able to relax. Imagine meditating “really hard” so you can have a mind-blowing out of body experience. It’s not gonna happen. The trick is to keep letting go and relaxing. This is why getting up in the middle of the night is so helpful, it’s easier to relax.<br><br>
      If you find a technique that works for you, keep going with it. Don’t hold on to any particular method. Don’t try to be perfect or get all upset if you can’t do it. It takes time, patience, practice, and dedication. But also openess, allowing, detachment, and letting go.</p>

    <div id="tips">
      <h2>tips</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Feel free to walk anywhere you would like. But do not go too far your first few times. If you are new to an astral plane, walk/fly to closer locations first.
          </li><br>
        <li>If you feel it's hard to get back to your body, just imagine yourself striking with your body at the speed of light. You can come back from any place with in one second. Remember your soul is free of distance and time.
          </li><br>
        <li>Visualize a white or yellowish light surrounding you while you Astral Project to protect yourself from bad entities who may suck your energy if you let them. Also, you can try to raise your vibrations.
          </li><br>
        <li>Never allow fear to overwhelm you. Whatever happens, keep your mind calm and stay in control of your thoughts, emotions, and acts. Fear is opposite to love. If you are under pressure of fear, there is a bigger possibility to visit the lower astral. If you rise your vibrations of unconditional love, you will visit higher astral where amazing worlds, sights, and beings exist.
          </li><br>
        <li>You cannot be hurt mentally/physically by something in the Astral Plane while having an OBE.
        </li><br>
        <li>Astral Projection can turn into whatever you want it to be. It can also make your growth in anything spiritual raise quickly which is why you should not give up. Its pretty easy for what it can help you do in the future.

      <h2>faq</h2>
      <p><span class="question">"Can I go anywhere I want?"</span><br>
      Yes. As long as you envision being there and you want to be there, you can go anywhere you want.
        <br><br>
      <span class="question">"Can I see other people in my Astral Plane?"</span><br>
      Yes. You can go wherever you want, even to completely unknown places, and you can watch other people without being noticed.
        <br><br>
      <span class="question">"Is it possible to see ghost?"</span><br>
      Yes, it is possible to see different entities. You're in the spiritual realm, therefore making you able to see ghosts.
        <br><br>
      <span class="question">"Will I die if I stay in the astral plane for too long?"</span><br>
      No. Astral projection uses your energy, soul, and mind. To return to your body, you must simply think of returning.
        <br><br>
      <span class="question">"If someone is in the astral plane, can anyone physically awake see, hear, or feel them?"</span><br>
      People that are sensitive to that kind of stuff can, but most people can not.
        <br><br>
      <span class="question">"What if someone tries to wake me up while my soul is out?"</span><br>
      You zap back instantly. This is the case whether the waking is through physical contact or as a result of a sudden noise nearby. It's harmless enough, but a bit annoying. </p>
